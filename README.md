# Mothership
This basic web server is used to serve all of the tools I need for exploitation and post-exploitation within the OSCP lab environment.  It also includes a simple file upload form for easy data exfiltration.

I've found that after gaining an initial foothold on a machine or low-level user access, the next big challenge is often transferring data back and forth between 'attacker' and 'victim'.  This is my attempt at simplifying the process.  By making available all of the tools that I would need during the post exploitaiton phase of an assessment (nc.exe, mimikatz, powersploit, etc), I can streamline my engagements and use my limited lab time more effectively.

This repo will also serve as a platform for me to deploy scripts, payloads, or anything else which I happen to find myself using frequently in an engagement.  Expect more good stuff soon...
